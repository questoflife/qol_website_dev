                        <p>At Quest of Life we believe that <span class="heavy-text">everyone should have access to
                                a supportive space</span> where they can feel safe, heard and understood. A space in
                            which nobody has to feel alone. We're on a mission to create this kind of support for anyone
                            who needs it, and especially those who can't access it elsewhere.</p>

                        <p>Growing up, many of us struggled
                            with social skills, making friends, fitting in, feeling like the weird kid, feeling alone...
                            But if we've learned one thing, it's that no matter what you're going through, or how broken
                            you might feel, it's not just you. And life gets a hell of a lot easier if you have a team
                            rooting for you. Maybe we can help you find yours.</p>

                        <p>We're a passionate team of volunteers here to help people like us as best as we can. Several
                            of us
                            started out as members in one of our groups, and, after seeing our lives change for the
                            better, decided we wanted to give back to the community and become facilitators.</p>
